  "message": "## \ud83d\udea8 What\u2019s happening\n\nHigh disk I/O wait time detected on host {{host.name}}.\n\nThis means one or more devices on the host are taking a long time to complete disk operations \u2014 averaging over 500ms in the last 5 minutes. High I/O wait time typically occurs when the system is frequently waiting for disk reads or writes to finish, often due to storage contention or inefficient disk usage by running processes.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8 Impact\n\nIf I/O wait remains high, it can lead to:\n\n- Slower application and system performance, especially for disk-intensive services\n- Delayed job processing or database queries\n- Risk of timeouts or service degradation due to blocked I/O operations\n\nSustained disk latency can have cascading effects on dependent services and degrade user experience.\n\n---\n\n## Runbook\n\n### Initial Troubleshooting Steps\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 How to fix (Runbook)\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Initial troubleshooting\n\n1. Identify the affected host and device from the alert.\n2. Open [**Infrastructure > Host Details**](/infrastructure) for {{host.name}}.\n3. In the **Metrics tab**, examine:\n   - `system.io.await` by device\n   - `system.disk.read_time`, `system.disk.write_time`, `system.disk.in_use`\n4. Use [**Live Processes**](/process) to find I/O-heavy processes.\n5. SSH into the host and run:\n   ```bash\n   iostat -xd 1 3\n   \n### Cause and Resolution\n\nCause | Resolution\n------|------\nDisk-heavy processes | Restart or optimize services with high I/O usage\n------|------\nBackup jobs, ETLs, logging | Schedule or throttle non-critical workloads\n------|------\nUnderlying disk performance | Check for slow or saturated disks, especially on network-attached volumes (e.g., EBS, NFS)\n------|------\nScale-out option | Move I/O-intensive tasks to separate or faster storage tiers\n        \n###  Related links\n\n* [Host Map](/infrastructure/map)\n* [Live Processes](/process?query=host%3A{{host.name}})\n* [System Dashboards](/dashboard/lists)\n* [Monitor Documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/)\n\n### Who should be notified?\n\nAssign the appropriate notification handle for this alert (e.g., `@slack-infra`, `@pagerduty-core-systems`):  \n`@your-team-handle`",
